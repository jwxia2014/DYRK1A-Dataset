# DYRK1A-Dataset

Introduction
-----------------------------------
DYRK1A-Dataset is the data set collected and curated for Machine Learning of DYRK1A molecules. 

Dataset Description
-----------------------------------
1. DYRK1A_IC50_all.csv
   This file contains the DYRK1A molecules that were collected from ChEMBL29 database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and curated by salt stripping, neutralization, SMILES standardization, the removal of compounds with too many rotatable bonds (>20) and too high molecular weight (>600) as well as the averaging of different IC50 values for the same compound. Please note the compounds with average IC50 below 1 Î¼M were defined as active compounds and the others were defined as inactive compounds.

3. Download 'xgboost-1.0.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl' from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#xgboost
4. Create a new directory, e.g. D:/HDAC3i-Finder and put the file 'xgboost-1.0.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl' in D:/HDAC3i-Finder  
5. Run 'Anaconda Prompt' and run the following commands:

   $ conda activate HDAC3
   
   $ pip install D:/HDAC3i-Finder/xgboost-1.0.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
   
   $ pip list | findstr xgboost (if 'xgboost 1.0.2' returns, xgboost is installed successfully) 

* Run HDAC3i-Finder
1. download HDAC3i-Finder.py and put it in a directory, e.g. D:/HDAC3i-Finder  
2. Run 'Anaconda Prompt' and run the following commands:

    $ conda activate HDAC3
  
    $ python D:/HDAC3i-Finder/HDAC3i-Finder.py (The GUI application will be shown)

Usage
-----------------------------------
* Single Compound mode

  This mode is used for predicting whether a single compound is active for HDAC3 or not.  
  1. click the 'load a model' to load the 'XGBoost_Morgan2.m' model and paste SMILES of a compound to predict. 
  2. click the 'Classify' button and the activity class of the compound is shown in the textbox along with the probability of the activity class. 

* A Set of Compounds mode (virtual screening)

  This mode is used for virtual screening of a large chemical library.  
  1. click the 'load a model' to load the 'XGBoost_Morgan2.m' model and provide a csv file with 'IDNUMBER' and 'SMILES' of the compounds to predict. 
  2. click the 'Classify' button and a csv file that contains activity classes with probability values of "being ACITVE" in a descending order returns.

# DYRK1A-Dataset

Introduction
-----------------------------------
DYRK1A-Dataset is the data set collected and curated for Machine Learning of DYRK1A molecules. 

Dataset Description
-----------------------------------
* DYRK1A_IC50_all.csv

   This file contains the DYRK1A molecules that were collected from ChEMBL29 database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and curated by salt stripping, neutralization, SMILES standardization, the removal of compounds with too many rotatable bonds (>20) and too high molecular weight (>600) as well as the averaging of different IC50 values for the same compound. Please note the compounds with average IC50 below 1 Î¼M were defined as active compounds and the others were defined as inactive compounds.

* DYRK1A_IC50_train.csv and DYRK1A_IC50_test.csv

   These two files contain the compounds in the training set (742 compounds) and those in the test set (185 compounds) by random partion.  

* MUBD_DYRK1A.csv  
   
   This file contains MUBD-DYRK1A (Maximal Biased Benchmarking Datasets for DYRK1A), which could be used for evaluating virtual screening strategies for DYRK1A inhibitors.
